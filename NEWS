0.11.1: A native FT2 drawing backend which may be faster than Pango on systems
        without Xft2.  Support for scrolling backgrounds for everyone.
0.11.0: Support for using font sets for better Unicode coverage when drawing
        using Xft2.  Support for scrolling backgrounds with Xft2.
0.10: Rewrote selection to better integrate dingus and autoscroll support.  The
      previous implementation was just a mess.  Changed the APIs so that callers
      have to decide whether or not to log (NOTE: this breaks gnome-terminal
      versions before 2.1.1 and 2.0.2).
0.9: Added integration with gnome-pty-helper.  This makes the lastlog/utmp/wtmp
     stuff work.
0.8: Added iso-2022 and national replacement character substitutions.  Line
     drawing characters are now represented as Unicode code points internally,
     so if you select a graphical line, you'll get the right results when you
     paste it.
0.7: Broke rendering code up into a couple of pieces to take advantage of
     Xft2 and Xlib APIs for drawing more than one character at a time.
0.6: Replaced the trie parser with a table-driven parser which is faster but
     only accurate enough for ANSI-compatible terminal types.  At some point
     I'll add a redirection layer to use the older code for other terminals.
0.5: Store characters as gunichars internally instead of wchar_t's.  Most of
     the internal processing is performed on gunichars anyway.
0.4: Support for Xft2 (which lets us do things faster than Xft1), and python
     bindings.
0.3: Initial accessibility peer implementation.

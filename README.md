Virtual TErminal
================

VTE provides a virtual terminal widget for GTK applications.

Installation
------------

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte  # Get the source code of VTE
$ cd vte                                        # Change to the toplevel directory
$ meson _build                                  # Run the configure script
$ ninja -C _build                               # Build VTE
[ Optional ]
$ ninja -C _build install                       # Install VTE to default `/usr/local`
```

* By default, VTE will install under `/usr/local`. You can customize the
prefix directory by `--prefix` option, e.g. If you want to install VTE under
`~/foobar`, you should run `meson _build --prefix=~/foobar`. If you already
run the configure script before, you should also pass `--reconfigure` option to it.

* You may need to execute `ninja -C _build install` as root
(i.e. `sudo ninja -C _build install`) if installing to system directories.

* If you wish to test VTE before installing it, you may execute it directly from
its build directory. As `_build` directory, it should be `_build/src/app/vte-[version]`.

* You can pass `-Ddebugg=true` option to meson if you wish to enable debug function.


Debugging
---------

After installing VTE with `-Ddebugg=true` flag, you can use `VTE_DEBUG` variable to control
VTE to print out the debug information

```
# You should change vte-[2.91] to the version you build
$ VTE_DEBUG=selection ./_build/src/app/vte-2.91

# Or, you can mixup with multiple logging level
$ VTE_DEBUG=selection,draw,cell ./_build/src/app/vte-2.91

$ Or, you can use `all` to print out all logging message
$ VTE_DEBUG=all ./_build/src/app/vte-2.91
```

For logging level information, please refer to enum [VteDebugFlags](src/debug.h).

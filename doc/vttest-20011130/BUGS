This is a list of known problems with VTTEST:

  + SD and SU tests pass with dtterm, but not with VT420, which uses a
    different scrolling model.

  + the skip_csi/skip_dcs functions are too permissive (they're allowing
    either 8-bit or 7-bit responses).

  + when I test the DECRQSS responses on a VT420, they usually come back
    with a code '1' (according to my manual, that's invalid), though the
    data looks correct otherwise.

  + testing on a VT420 (console on VMS), there's a problem with the VT52 test: 
    I see highlighted glitches at the positions where erase line (ESC K)
    controls are printed.  Increasing the padding doesn't change this behavior.

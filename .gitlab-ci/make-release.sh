# deliberately, and unless and until there exist a way to do this
# again (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/569974)
# the tag's pipeline needs to be triggered manually.

# As an added complication, while the release pipeline knows the
# version (by tracing meson), here we don't know it. The user must

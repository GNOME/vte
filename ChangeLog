2002-09-18 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Corrected a problem with yesterday's patch.  I am now
	properly calling g_source_remove on the scroll_delay timeout
	function.  This prevents VTE from core dumping if you start up
	more than one VTE gnome-terminal and exit from one of them.  Also
	made the vte_scroll_timeout function a little cleaner by using
	the VTE_IS_TERMINAL macro.

2002-09-17 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Fixed bug with my 09/11 speedup fix which caused programs
	that update the screen non-linearly like lynx to not update properly.
	Also included a speed improvement which delays the scroll-down for
	70ms.  Too fast to be noticeable to the user, but it speeds up VTE
	greatly.

2002-09-13 nalin
	* src/pty.c: Fix typo which broke builds on systems where MSG_NOSIGNAL
	is defined.

2002-09-12 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* configure.in : Added -lsocket to LIBS if socket is in libsocket,
	so VTE will compile on Solaris.

2002-09-12  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* src/pty.c: only use MSG_NOSIGNAL if it's defined

	* gnome-pty-helper/gnome-pty-helper.c (struct pty_info): remove
	master_fd and slave_fd fields
	(shutdown_pty): don't close master/slave fd's here...
	(pty_add): don't take master/slave fd args
	(open_ptys): ...close master/slave fd's right after passing them

	this fixes a hang after closing a window on os x, not sure why...

	* gnome-pty-helper/Makefile.am (install-exec-hook): remove
	trailing / after $DESTDIR

	* configure.in: AC_CHECK_FUNC() doesn't do AC_DEFINE(HAVE_FOO), so
	do that for socket() and socketpair() if they are found

2002-09-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_invalidate_cursor_once): Remove the invalidate_cells
	parameter, because the function is a big no-op if FALSE, in which case
	we should just not call it instead. (vte_terminal_process_incoming):
	refresh the right number of rows after processing a block of data.

2002-09-12 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c Fixed minor error with my previous patch.  This just makes
	a warning go away.
  
2002-09-11 nalin
	* src/pty.c: Reorder definitions to avoid implicit declaration warnings.
	* configure.in: Check for socketpair().  Check for socket() in libc
	before poking around in libsocket.
	* gnome-pty-helper/configure.in: Check for openpty() in libutil as well,
	and do so before we check for other functions.

2002-09-11 nalin
	* configure.in, gnome-pty-helper/cofnigure.in: Test for sendmsg() with
	AC_CHECK_FUNCS instead of AC_TRY_COMPILE.
	* acconfig.h: Removed.
	* src/pty.c: Formatting.

2002-09-11 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* configure.in: Added check for socket library and SendMsg
	check. 
	* acconfig.h: Added this file with a HAVE_SENDMSG definition.
	* gnome-pty-helper/configure.in: Added checks needed for the
	source code, including the SendMsg check.
	* src/pty.c: Corrected _vte_pty_pipe_open so it works on
	Solaris.
	*src/vte.c: Made some speed improvements so vte_invalidate_cells
	is not called for every character in the while loop in 
	vte_process_incoming, but only once when the while loop is done.

2002-09-11 nalin
	* gnome-pty-helper: Update from libzvt CVS.
	* python/Makefile.am: Fix some automake breakage.

2002-09-11 nalin
	* python/Makefile.am: Fix my broken merge of Jacob's patch to make
	inability to build python modules non-fatal.

2002-09-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Skip lookups for padding information if we're pretty sure
	we're using a monospaced font.

2002-09-10 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix from Brian Cameron for uninitialized GError in
	vte_wc_from_unichar().
	* src/interpret.c, src/iso2022.c, src/pty.c, src/ring.h, src/table.c,
	src/table.h, src/trie.c, src/vte.c, src/vteaccess.c: Signed/unsigned
	int/size_t/gsize and pointer typecast warning fixes from Brian Cameron.
	* src/vte.c: Avoid invalidating the cursor in the cursor blink
	timeout unless we have focus.

2002-09-10  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>
	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS: remove es until the file really gets
	added.  also it wasn't added alphabetically

2002-09-10 Pablo Gonzalo del Campo <pablodc@bigfoot.com>

        * configure.in: Added "es" to ALL_LINGUAS

2002-09-10 nalin
	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h: Add vte_pty_close() and
	vte_pty_open_with_logging(), breaking the ABI.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Add vte_terminal_fork_logged_command(), breaking
	the ABI.
	* gnome-pty-helper/*: Swallow the pty helper bits of gnome-libs,
	but install into $pkglibdir instead of $sbindir so that existing
	packages don't suddenly start breaking.
	* src/termcap.c(_vte_termcap_find_string_length): Fix signature to
	match the declaration in termcap.h.  From patch by Jacob Berkman.

2002-09-06 nalin
	* configure.in: Add $X_PRE_LIBS to the front of $X_LIBS, -lX11 and
	$X_EXTRA_LIBS to the end of $X_LIBS.  Remove some cruftiness and set
	CPPFLAGS when checking for Xft.  Check for the existence of wchar.h,
	because it might not exist.  Use an automake conditional to make
	compilation of the Python bindings non-critical.  From patch by
	Jacob Berkman.
	* src/pty.c: Silence compiler warning when exec() fails.  From patch
	by Jacob Berkman.
	* src/interpret.c, src/vte.c: Stop including langinfo.h since we don't
	call nl_langinfo() any more.  Adapted from patch by Jacob Berkman.
	* src/caps.c: Fill in a couple of missing initializers.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Add accessor functions for use in language
	bindings.
	* python/vte.defs: Add defs for the new accessor functions.
	* python/vte-demo.py: Add a scrollbar to the sample window, handle
	more of the options the C version handles.  Stop expecting additional
	arguments with a signal that doesn't include any.
	* python/Makefile.am: We only have one target, so don't bother with
	target-specific primaries if we can avoid it (#92252).
	* vte.pc.in: Note build dependencies on ATK, Pango, and PangoX.

2002-09-05 nalin
	* src/caps.c, src/caps.h, src/debug.c, src/debug.h, src/interpret.c,

	src/trie.c, src/trie.h, src/utf8echo.c, src/vte.c, src/vteaccess.c,
	src/vteapp.c: prefix library-internal interfaces with underscores so
	that gtk-doc doesn't guess they're public.
	* src/vte.c: return FALSE from focus-in/focus-out/expose handlers.

2002-09-05 nalin
	* src/caps.h, src/debug.h, src/iso2022.h, src/marshal.h, src/ring.h,
	src/table.h, src/termcap.h, src/trie.h: add giant warnings about how
	these headers define library-internal interfaces.
	* vte.spec: 0.8.18

2002-09-05 nalin
	* docs/reference: first pass at writing documentation
	* src/termcap.c: fix how'd-that-ever-work in vte_termcap_strip(), patch
	from Brian Cameron.  Take \\e as an alias for \\E, which is already
	an alias for Escape.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_cursor): Return an absolute cursor position
	instead of a relative position.

2002-09-04  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* src/vte.c (vte_default_substitute): only compile the FC_HINT_STYLE
	part if FC_HINT_STYLE is defined

2002-09-04 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Add missing <fontconfig/fontconfig.h> include for Xft2,
	spotted by Jacob Berkman.

2002-09-04 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>
	* src/vte.c: Avoid double color deallocations with Xft.
	* configure.in: Added stropts.h check for Solaris.
	* src/vte.c: Do not send data to the slave if the length is zero.
	Some shells on Solaris do not handle this well.
	* src/pty.c: Added ptem/ldterm/ttcompat ioctls so VTE will work
	on Solaris.

2002-09-03 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Avoid double color deallocations with Xft.

2002-09-03 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle color allocation failures with Xft better.
	* src/vte.h: Clean up typedef declarations.

2002-09-03 nalin
	* src/marshal.list, src/reaper.c, src/reaper.h, src/vte.c: Modify the
	child-exited signal to pass a signed int and an unmodified exit status,
	allowing the callback to check for normal/abnormal exit status.

2002-09-02 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't send zero-length strings to the child -- it may not
	be able to cope properly.  Spotted by Brian Cameron.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Handle cursor exposes correctly for multicolumn characters,
	no matter which cell the cursor is in.  Fix autoscrolling boundary
	checks for when allocation.y != 0.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_insert_char): Wrap correctly to avoid screwing
	up multicolumn characters.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Get smarter about when it's necessary to start messing
	with our adjustments (Red Hat #73091).  Change the way we clear the
	screen so that all of the contents of the current screen become
	scrollback data.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Register VteTerminalEraseBinding with GObject as an
	enumerated type.
	* python/vte.defs: Update.
	* python/vte.overrides: Ignore vte_terminal_get_text_range().

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Restore the focus-in/focus-out handlers -- the defaults
	don't quite DTRT for us because they miss our im_context (#72946).  When
	setting the cursor location for the input method, make the Y coordinate
	relative to the window, not the scrollback buffer.  When resizing the
	scrollback buffer, clamp the cursor to the set of possible locations,
	not the visible locations.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Initialize the pty master fd to -1 to avoid spurious
	window resizes on fd 0.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: Add a "pty" debug message class.

2002-08-30 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c: Fix a how'd-that-ever-work bug (not returning anything
	from vte_iso2022_new()), spotted by Brian Cameron.
	* configure.in: Use -Wall when building with gcc in maintainer mode.
	* src/interpret.c, src/ring.h, src/table.c, src/trie.c, src/vte.c,
	src/vteaccess.c: Warning cleanups.

2002-08-29 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Clean up bookkeeping for mouse autoscrolling and adjustment
	change notifications.  Reset the scrolling and insertion deltas when
	clearing the history.
	* src/interpret.c: Don't dump data on incomplete conversion errors,
	which we're going to retry anyway.
	* src/iso2022.txt: Add iso-2022-kr examples (no workee -- uses GR).

2002-08-28 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Add vte_terminal_copy_primary and
	vte_terminal_paste_primary(), because I really want to let
	profterm decide default values for key bindings.

2002-08-28  Gustavo Noronha Silva  <kov@debian.org>
	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added pt_BR

2002-08-27 nalin

	can see.

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement autoscroll (Red Hat #70481).

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Only perform cr-lf substitutions when pasting text, not
	when inputting from a live user (Red Hat #72639).  Bind GDK_ISO_Left_Tab
	to kB.  Formatting changes.
	* termcaps/xterm: Bind kB to back-tab (Red Hat #70340).

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't tamper with the scrolling offsets -- they're updated
	when we handle adjustment_changed notifications.  Scroll instead of just
	moving the cursor down when soft-wrapping to the next line.  Avoid
	emitting adjustment_changed when only the value has changed, likewise
	for the value and the other fields of the adjustment.

2002-08-27 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Keep cursor position and scrolling offsets from going
	wonky when you resize, especially on the alternate screen.  Suppress
	duplicate adjustment_changed notifications.
	* src/vteapp.c: Set the MIN_SIZE geometry hints so that we can resize
	to unreasonably-small dimensions.
	* src/ring.c, src/ring.h: Add vte_ring_new_with_delta().

2002-08-26 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Add padding spaces after full lines as well -- spotted by
	both notting and pjones.

2002-08-26 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't deadlock when substitution fails, spotted by msw.

2002-08-26 nalin
	* src/vte.c: If GDK_USE_XFT is set, check the value of GDK_USE_XFT, not
	VTE_USE_XFT.  Spotted by hp.

2002-08-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Heed the reverse-video setting when painting character
	cells again.  Make selection and matching coordinates global, fixing
	the selecting-while-scrolling case.  Prevent overdraws into the padding
	area on the right.

2002-08-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Make nd() move right but not wrap -- according to Strang
	it's undefined, but xterm doesn't wrap it.  Separate do/DO from sf/SF
	and up/UP from sr/SR, because the scrolling behavior is supposed to be
	different.  Add support for decset/decreset 7 (wraparound mode) and
	1051 (Sun keyboard).  Add support for DECALN.  Remove some type checks
	from run-time which the compiler can catch with certainty.

2002-08-25  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>
	* configure.in: Added Norwegian (no) to ALL_LINGUAS.
	
2002-08-25  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* src/iso2022.c: Fix an off-by-one which incorrectly triggered an
	assertion.
	* src/vte.c: Implement send-primary/secondary-device-attributes.  Bind
	shift+insert to "paste PRIMARY".  Guard against NULL window/icon title
	when telling the child app what they are.  Prevent DO(), up(), and UP()
	from scrolling.

2002-08-22 nalin
	* src/vteapp.c: Set geometry hints using the initial font setup.
2002-08-22 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Make use of the visible bell a separate option
	from use of the audible bell, allowing both/neither to be used.  Open
	fonts right away again -- profterm reads the metrics right after calling
	set_font(), so we have to open fonts ASAP.  Rework the Xft/Pango/Xlib
	decision code to be more consistent.  Watch for style changes and reset
	our font to the new style's font when we're already using the old
	style's font.
2002-08-21 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c(vte_iso2022_substitute): Take a vte_table as an
	additional argument, and don't mess with text that's part of a control
	sequence, even if it's in shifted-out text.
	* src/table.c(vte_table_match): Speed up for the no-arguments-requested
	case, which just became much more common.
2002-08-21 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_rows): Cap the maximum number of
	characters we draw in a single call to vte_terminal_draw_cells at a
	reasonable number.
2002-08-21 nalin
	* src/table.c: Don't overwrite the original pattern pointers before
	freeing the old value.
	* src/vte.c: Use the same pango context whenever possible, to save on
	PangoX startup time.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Unref the output channel one more time when we're done
	sending data to the child.  Free the background data GDK property when
	we're finished with it.  Don't retrieve the pango context when drawing
	unless Xft has already been disabled.  Don't try to use the pango layout
	to draw unless it's valid.  Don't try to use the XftDraw item to draw
	unless it's valid.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Dispose of the updated substitution context properly when
	processing blocks of input text.  Spotted by Arjan van de Ven.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/ring.c: Debug when rows get freed.
	* src/vte.c: Maybe-release pango contexts after unreffing layouts which
	refer to them.  Decide on how we want to draw fonts before deciding
	which fonts to draw, to avoid spurious font loading.  Remove output tags
	when the output tag's callback is about to return FALSE.
2002-08-20 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't leak the hintstyle and rgba settings.  Patch from
	Arjan van de Ven.  Free PangoX contexts when we're done with them,
	spotted by Arjan van de Ven.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Load fonts just-in-time to avoid spurious reloads.  Don't
	override the focus_in and focus_out event handlers -- the defaults DTRT.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: Add a RING debug class.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/iso2022.c: Handle override maps which don't affect the font
	palette correctly, resetting at newlines and escape marks.  Process
	bogon data correctly.
	* src/iso2022.txt: Add some sample text.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fixup some fontconfig/Xft mixups.  Set the hint style
	instead of hinting when reading the GTK hint style setting (spotted
	by katzj and otaylor).
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/vte.h, src/vte.c: Use gssize instead of ssize_t.  Perform
	substitutions while processing.  Use PangoX contexts when we're using
	the PangoX fontmap and when doing PangoX rendering.
2002-08-19 nalin
	* src/mkunitables.sh,src/unitable.*: Add.
	* src/iso2022.c, src/iso2022.h: Use unitables.
	* src/caps.c: Remove sequences for designating character sets.  Switch
	to using a second passed-in buffer for storing results in case the
	caller doesn't want substitutions done in-place.
	* src/debug.c, src/debug.h: Add a substitution debug flag.
	* src/interpret.c: Perform substitution.
	* src/table.c, src/table.h: Use gssize instead of ssize_t.

	hex format.
2002-08-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_configure_toplevel): repaint the entire window
	to ensure that any overdraw area we're not paying attention to at least
	gets cleared to the background.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_locale_encoding): don't try to second-guess
	the local encoding, just use the current charset as returned by
	g_get_charset().
2002-08-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_reset): drop pending incoming data on reset.
	* src/vte.c: give reprocessing of pending input data a higher priority
	than reading it from the child to prevent backlogs on corrupt or invalid
	multibyte data from building up and whacking us exponentially.
2002-08-13 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_sequence_handler_delete_lines): initialize lines added
	to the current default colors.  Spotted by jrb.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_font): don't try to pick up GTK Xft
	settings unless we're using FontConfig.  Patch from otaylor.
2002-08-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c: reorder set/reset processing for decset so that 1049

	we were built with (hopefully).
2002-08-11 nalin

	updates when the widget isn't realized.  Patch from Gustavo Giráldez.
2002-08-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c: take extra steps to make sure that the cursor doesn't go
	back into negative scrollback space.
2002-08-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_invalidate_all): rewrite.
2002-08-08 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_paint,vte_terminal_draw_cells): fill in the
	background color when drawing the cursor, even if it's going to end up
	as the default background color, spotted by Peter Jones.  Draw the
	cursor correctly if it's over a graphic character.
2002-08-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_cells): once again, avoid drawing NULs.
	* src/vte.c: add a small pad to each edge (#89048).
	* src/vteapp.c: handle widget padding.
2002-08-07 nalin
	* src/interpret.c: look for $pkgdatadir/termcap/$TERM first, as the
	widget does, before consulting /etc/termcap.
	* src/ring.c(vte_ring_free): check for a non-NULL removal function
	before calling it.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_key_press): add an option for doing

	(#89506).

	switch back to PangoX.
2002-08-06 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_encoding,
	vte_sequence_handler_local_charset): use g_get_charset() instead of
	nl_langinfo() to determine the default codeset, and to check if it's
	UTF-8.  Patch from Hidetoshi Tajima.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_encoding): don't leak conversion
	descriptors when changing the encoding fails.  Patch from Hidetoshi
	Tajima.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_send): don't read past the converted string
	when performing paste substitutions.
	* src/vte.c: rework the straight-Pango rendering routines to call

	case a bit.
2002-08-05 nalin

	provide a boolean to control whether or not the endpoint is "in".
	* src/vte.c(vte_cell_draw_rows): check if a cell is selected using
	the right indicator.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_get_text): when adding a newline to the end
	of a returned line, don't show it as being in the rightmost column.
	* src/vte.c(xlfd_from_pango_font_description): turn the DPI, pixel size,
	and added info into wildcards.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_draw_cells): go back to drawing individual
	cells when using Xlib.
	* src/vte.c: Compute right-side padding as well as left.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_init): disable use of PangoX by default.
	* src/vteapp.c: add -D to add the same patterns profterm does to test
	dingus hiliting.

2002-08-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_setup_background): add a gdk_flush()
	before the error trap pop, just for paranoia, may help with 
	#89049

2002-08-02 nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_send): Substitute carriage returns for
	newlines when pasting text to the child, fixing weird paste behavior
	in pico and friends.

2002-08-02  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* configure.in: Added fr to ALL_LINGUAS.

2002-08-01  nalin
	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h: Expose vte_pty_set_size() and get_size() to
	localize terminal ioctl usage.
	* src/ring.c(vte_ring_validate): Don't repeatedly compute the same
	value when we know it won't change.
	* src/vte.c(vte_wc_from_unichar): Implement for the non-STDC_ISO_10646
	case, heavily based on patch from Hidetoshi Tajima.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_ensure_cursor): Don't initialize the local
	data unless we have to.
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_process_incoming): Don't insert NUL characters
	into the display, matching behavior of xterm.
	* src/vte.c: Clean up use of various G_PRIORITY values throughout to
	allow for simpler tuning.  Rewrite rendering code to use per-paint
	PangoLayouts when they're needed, use Xft2's DrawCharSpec function when
	available, and to cut down on X requests.  Don't paint on expose events
	if the window isn't realized, drawable, and at least partially visible.
	Don't deselect previous selection when the user clicks unless there's
	also a drag first.
2002-07-31  nalin
	* src/pty.c: Include <termios.h> if available, per patch from Hidetoshi
	Tajima.
	* src/trie.c: Include missing <wchar.h>, spotted by Hidetoshi Tajima.
	* src/vte.c: Initialize new lines created in insert_lines() to the
	current default attributes like al() does.
2002-07-30  nalin
	* configure.in: Check for wint_t and attempt to allow compiles even
	when wint_t isn't defined (this type is used only debug code, so it
	shouldn't break anything).
	* src/caps.c: Remove "te" and "ti", which are logical, in the same way
	"so" is, from the known capabilities lists.  Add a "is a key" field to
	the termcap list so that we don't match against keystrokes in case
	they're also control sequences.
	* src/interpret.c: Use tables instead of tries.  Don't add key sequences
	to the table.
	* src/pty.c: Fix incorrect invocation in sample.
	* src/reaper.c: Include stdlib.h to quiet compiler warning.
	* src/trie.c, src/trie.h: Remove the unused precomputing routines.
	* src/utf8echo.c: Switch to link with tables instead of tries.
	* src/vte.c: Switch to using tables instead of tries.  Map
	cursor-backward to LE instead of le, which handles parameters right.
	Don't add key sequences to the parsing table.  Tune updates so that
	they occur less often when we're processing large amounts of data from
	the child.  Add a 'status-line-changed' signal.  Implement fs() and
	fix ts().  Add ::get_status_line() to get the contents of the status
	line.  Obey it() when setting default tabstops.  Implement
	cursor_next_line(), cursor_lower_left(), cursor_preceding_line(),
	cursor_horizontal_and_vertical_position(), erase_characters(), and
	insert_blank_characters().  Implement nw().

2002-07-26  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Initialize new lines added for al().  Spotted by jrb.

2002-07-25  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* configure.in: Added Danish translation.

2002-07-25  nalin

	* src/pty.c: Set the proper number of columns in the window size.
	* src/ring.h: Change macro argument names to hopefully not step on
	application code.
	* src/vte.c: Set the terminal size to the default size as specified in
	termcap at init-time.
2002-07-24  nalin
	* src/pty.c: Add private vte_pty_set_size() function.
	* src/pty.c, src/pty.h: vte_pty_open() takes size arguments now.
	* src/vte.c: Open the PTY with the proper initial size.
2002-07-23  nalin
	* src/ring.c, ring.h: Expose the ring implementation and convert several
	simple functions into macros.
	* src/vteapp.c: Pass all long options on to gtk_init().
2002-07-23  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix realize/unrealize to be properly reversible.  Use the
	font from the default style unless we're explicitly given one.
	* src/vteapp.c: Don't set base size or minimum size geometry hints when
	sizing the terminal widget.
2002-07-22  nalin
	* src/pty.c(vte_pty_ptsname): Fix an incorrect logic check.
2002-07-19  nalin
	* src/vte.c(vte_terminal_set_color_internal): If we're changing the
	background color, apply it to the widget's window as well, from msw.
2002-07-19  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Undo the scrolling changes -- there too many combinations
	of circumstances that cause them to not work right.
2002-07-18  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fudge the repaint line count by one when scrolling regions
	to ensure that the old cursor gets repainted.  Calculate the area which
	needs to be repainted when reverse-scrolling correctly.
2002-07-18  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement enough of set-mode and reset-mode to allow
	toggling of insert mode using this sequence.  Move all scrolling into
	vte_terminal_scroll_region and use gdk_draw_drawable to avoid repainting
	from scratch whenever possible.
2002-07-17  nalin
	* configure.in: Actually set ALL_LINGUAS so translations get installed.
	* README: Document the weirdness that is cursor movement around wide
	characters.
	* src/vte.defs: Bind set_color_bold().
	* src/debug.c: Suppress warnings when $VTE_DEBUG_FLAGS isn't set.
	* src/pty.c, src/reaper.c, src/termcap.c, src/trie.c: Provide for
	debug messages in the test program.
	* src/interpret.c, src/trie.c: Use libc stdio instead of g_print for
	printing what might be part of a multibyte sequence because g_print
	checks for validity.
	* src/interpret.c, src/trie.c, src/utf8echo.c, src/vte.c: Use gunichar
	instead of wchar_t in places where a gunichar is expected.  Provide a
	means for converting from wchar_t to gunichar for the sake of X11 calls
	which want a wchar_t.
	* src/trie.c: Provide vte_trie_wide_encoding() for finding a giconv
	target which is hopefully compatible with gunichar.  Likewise provide
	vte_trie_narrow_encoding() to find one compatible with iso-8859-1.
	* src/vte.c: Fall back to ISO-8859-1 if we can't set things up for the
	current locale encoding at startup time.  Fall back to the current
	encoding if we can't perform a given dynamic switch.
2002-07-16  nalin
	* configure.in: Set GETTEXT_PACKAGE correctly, noted by menthos.

2002-07-16  nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_colors): Guess at an appropriate bold
	version of the foreground color instead of hard-coding in a default.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h (vte_terminal_set_color_bold): Add.

2002-07-16  nalin
	* src/trie.c: Correctly check for g_iconv_open() failure.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_encoding): Try to give a meaningful
	error when g_iconv_open() fails, even though we're screwed.

2002-07-15  nalin
	* src/vte.c: wrap the new Xft/fontconfig-specific code in HAVE_XFT
	* src/vte.c: Revert some changes in how new cells were initialized,
	removing various cosmetic problems.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_process_incoming): Discard the proper number
	of characters when we don't recognize a sequence, previously we left
	one byte that should have been removed.

2002-07-14  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_cursor_position): decrement spaces
	as we go through the loop, it was nice and infinite.

2002-07-13 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_text): Add the proper number of attribute
	structs to the attribute array to fix crashes which occurred when the
	buffer contains non-ASCII text (Red Hat #67930).
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Small optimization in the al() and dl() handlers.  al()
	doesn't move the cursor, per GNU termcap docs.  Check for a pixbuf in
	the bgfx check instead of pixmap, which was the wrong type.
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Add patch to heed Xft/fontconfig settings as kept by GTK.
	Based on patch from otaylor.
2002-07-12 nalin
	* src/slowcat.c: Added.
	* src/vteapp.c: Add -a/-b flags to control audible bell and blinking
	cursors.  Only send "pwd" as an initial command if there wasn't a
	command specified on the command line.  Add a simple help message.
	* src/vte.c: Bind F13-F35 per termcap.  Treat GDK_KP_Delete as
	GDK_Delete.  Map Ctrl+F1-F12 to F13-F24.  Fix dc() to ensure that the
	rows stays full and that newly-added cells get the default attributes.
	Fix cl() to clear all rows on the screen with the default attributes
	(bce).  Default to using Xft if available for consistency with GTK.
2002-07-11 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Treat super, hyper, meta, and alt as modifiers when
	deciding to scroll-on-keypress.  Noted by jrb.
	* src/vte.c: Always map \r and \n to cr and so, even when they're
	defined by the termcap.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Rework how default colors are set up, and add
	vte_terminal_set_color_foreground and vte_terminal_set_color_background.
	* src/vte.h: Remove includes for local headers which apps are not
	likely to never use, cleaning up the namespace a little.
	* python/vte.defs: Bind vte_terminal_set_color_{fore,back}ground.
	* src/debug.h, src/ring.h: Use G_BEGIN_DECLS/G_END_DECLS.

	transparency.
2002-07-02 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Make shift+button1 extend selection.
2002-07-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_draw_char): Draw unicode line-drawing code
	points natively as we do for the GR1 support, in case the current font
	doesn't include glyphs for them.
	* src/vte.c: Test for g_iconv_open() failure properly (compare result
	to ((GIConv)-1), not NULL).
	* src/vte.c: Rework recovery from illegal sequence errors in the input
	stream to be much more aggressive about it.
2002-06-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Bind F10 to "k;", not "k0".
	* termcaps/xterm: Add "k;" defined as F10.
2002-06-25 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_reset_rowdata): Check for redundant resizes.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_set_scrollback_lines): Keep the alternate
	screen buffer size the same as the window height, because xterm's
	alternate screen doesn't backscroll.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_text): Don't append spaces to multicolumn
	characters when reading the screen's contents.
	* src/vte.c: Don't overexpose neighboring cells any more.  Cleanups.
	* src/ring.h, src/ring.c: Add vte_ring_max() to read a ring's maximum
	size.
2002-06-24 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal): Treat option 1049
	as a combination of 1047 and 1048.
	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_finalize): When finalizing while holding the
	selection, throw the selection onto the clipboard without an owner so
	that it doesn't just disappear.
2002-06-19 nalin
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_set_title_int): Fix a logic bug
	that got rid of the title always, not just when conversion failed.
2002-06-19 nalin

2002-06-18 nalin
	* autogen.sh: Correct automake version check to require 1.5, heads
	up from Glynn Foster.
2002-06-18 nalin
	* src/trie.c (vte_trie_match, vte_trie_match_x): Sort out greedy vs.
	non-greedy pattern matching.
	* src/vte.c (vte_sequence_handler_decset_internal): Make 1047 an alias

	installed in the prefix we're configuring for.
	* src/Makefile.am: Link libvte to its library dependencies.
2002-06-13 nalin
	* src/vteaccess.c: Stop watching for hierarchy-changed signals -- the
	accessible container which is our parent handles it already (from msw).
2002-06-13 nalin
	* src/vteaccess.c: Re-read cursor position immediately on "cursor-moved"
	events, and emit the "text-caret-moved" signal then as well.  Don't
	override the signal handlers for signals we emit, bad things can
	happen (from msw).
2002-06-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Re-read the termcap when we change emulation, because
	the location of the file may have changed.
	* src/reaper.c: Also tell the parent the child died when the child
	dies due to an uncaught signal.
	* python/vte.override (_wrap_vte_terminal_fork_command): Handle default
	value for the command.
2002-06-12 msw

	* src/vte.c (vte_terminal_get_accessible): turn the logic around
	to be the right way
2002-06-12 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Cache the result of vte_terminal_get_accessible() and
	unref it at finalize-time.  Add debug messages to log signals emitted
	by the widget.  Implement vte_terminal_get_encoding and
	vte_terminal_get_emulation, emit signals when these change.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Emit a "text_caret_moved" signal when the cursor
	moves.
	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Add rules for building python modules.
2002-06-12 msw
	* src/vteaccess.c (vte_terminal_accessible_get_text): accept
	end_offset of -1, which means "until the end".
	* src/vteaccess.c (vte_terminal_accessible_new): never set the
	description to a NULL pointer
2002-06-10 nalin
	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Include gettext support.
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Expose vte_terminal_set_encoding().

	possible translation.
2002-06-07 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Center characters in their cells, caching their extents.
2002-06-06 nalin
	* src/vte.c, src/vte.h: Add get_cursor_position(). Remove get_snapshot()
	and free_shapshot().
	* src/vte.c: Fix a logic bug that caused us to scroll to the bottom
	even if the user just pressed and released a modifier key.  Fix saving
	of the font in set_font() in most cases, where we weren't saving the
	new font before.  Scroll-to-bottom on input method commits, which are
	also the result of keystrokes, when scroll-on-keystroke is enabled.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Rework to use get_text() and get_cursor_position()
	instead of get_snapshot(), so that selection and accessibility both
	agree on what's visible (or "visible").
2002-06-05 nalin
	* configure.in: Check for pangoxft with Xft1 or Xft2, hopefully getting
	things right for either case.  Originally from patch by andersca.
	* src/reaper.c, src/reaper.h: Add a singleton object to watch for
	SIGCHLD when child processes quit.
	* src/vte.c: Emit a "child-exited" signal when a child started with
	fork_command() exits.
	* src/vte.c: Make a better guess at font metrics when using Xft by
	measuring the extents for a string of representative characters.
	* src/vte.defs: Add.  Not very useful yet.
2002-05-31 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement font setting using PangoX to convert Pango
	font descriptions to core font xlfds for use when drawing with Xlib.
2002-05-29 nalin
	* src/trie.c, src,vte.c: Finish switching iconv to g_iconv.  I think
	this was a part of Hidetoshi Tajima's patch that I lost.  Free regexes
	when we're done with them.
2002-05-28 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix matching when scrolling delta isn't zero.  Fix async
	background updating (report from Richard Neal Plana).  Fix cb() and ce()
	when the cursor is on a line without data (needed to create it) and when
	cells being cleared don't exist (needed to create them) (report from
	Garret LeSage).
	* src/vte.c, src/vteaccess.c: Always free the segment when freeing
	arrays and strings.

2002-05-24 nalin

	Hidetoshi Tajima to fix building on Solaris systems, remove use of
	syntax that might be specific to gcc, and fix an overrun in
	vte_termcap_generate().  (#82433)

2002-05-18 andersca
	* src/vte.c: Don't queue a background update if the background isn't
	transparent.

2002-05-16 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Snip trailing whitespace off of copied lines, insert
	an end-of-line only when the copied line doesn't go to the right edge,
	don't overrun right edge, even in insert mode.  Fix displaying of
	underlined text.  Finish implementing matching.

2002-05-15 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Send kI on insert key.  Don't send drag events when the
	child has only asked for click events.  Fix crashbugs in selection.
	When getting scroll events, send mouse 4/5 events to the child instead
	of performing a history scroll if the child wants mouse events.  Start
	adding match support, merging how selection views the buffer with how
	matching views the buffer, though matching doesn't work yet.

2002-05-14 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Don't try to draw nul characters, most fonts can't.  Don't
	send motion-tracking events to the child unless we're dragging.  Fix
	ce so that it works even right after startup.  Make sure that repainting
	the entire window actually exposes the visible parts of the window.  Fix
	tab clearing to also allow removal of the current tabstop.  Implement
	save-mode and restore-mode.  Start on reverse-video mode.  Don't scroll
	on modifier keypress events.  Rework part of clipboard copy.
	* termcaps/xterm: Add missing F11/F12/End keysyms to bundled xterm
	termcap.

	attribute.  Handle am, bw, ul flags properly.  Make cd clear the current
	line, too.  Make ce fill the current default attributes through the end
	of the line.  Handle cS.  Fix cv to work when we have a scrollback
	buffer.  Handle ll, mp.  Line wrap on nd.  Reset tab stops on hard
	reset only.  Handle soft-reset and full-reset.  Handle uc.  Initialize
	scrollback line count properly.  Tweak drawing of alternate 'a' to
	get rid of artifacts.  Reset insert mode, cursor visibility, and
	scrolling regions when resetting.
2002-05-10 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fix IC, which should *always* be done in insert mode,
	from otaylor.  Make delete mode do nothing.
2002-05-09 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Fixes to usage of iconv, from otaylor.  Remap certain
	characters which are missing in the current Xft font to similar
	characters if they are in the font, from otaylor.  Change default
	emulation to "xterm", cleaning up confusion over what standout really
	means.  Reorganize some internals.  Complain when an application sends
	us a key-press sequence, as if we knew what to do with one of those.
	Implement bt, ct, st.  Reimplement ta.

	signals to be more consistent.  Add thin wrappers for emitting signals,
	and use them everywhere.  Support pangox even when XFT isn't available.
	Try to provide bold text again.  Add signals for most of the window
	manipulation control sequences.  Start handling mouse button events.
	Hide the mouse cursor when we get keyboard events.  Use a different
	mouse cursor if the child is mouse-aware.  Handle eA() by treating it as
	as().
	* src/caps.c, src/caps.h: Export definitions of VTE_CAP_CSI and friends.
2002-05-04 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Implement device-status-report and dec-device-status-
	report.  Clamp location values in sequence_handler_cm() to the

2002-05-03 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Export a vte_termcap_strip() function for preprocessing
	escape sequences and whatnot from capability values.
	* src/typescrypt: Removed.
	* src/vte.c: Pass the hard-coded xterm-specific capabilities through
	vte_termcap_strip(), which fixes a few weird bugs.  Discard invalid
	might-be-control-sequence sequences, like other emulators do.  Don't
	consider modifier keys, by themselves, to be enough to scroll-on-key.
	When snapshotting, actually snapshot all of a row instead of just the
	last character.  Don't run past the end of snapshot contents when
	reading them.
	* src/vteaccess.c: Clamp offsets so that they always sort right.
2002-05-02 nalin
	* src/termcap.c: Fix handling of triple-digit escaped characters,
	which weren't being processed right if the first digit was '1' instead
	of '0'.
	* src/trie.c: Rework trie matching to return the address of the
	character which ended the match attempt, which should cut down on
	useless initial-substring checks.  Fix a subtle bug which caused
	intermittent off-by-somenumber errors in the return address.
	* src/vte.c:  Remove several gdk_window_scroll() calls which apparently
	aren't buffered.  Convert invalid multibyte characters to '?' instead of
	just dropping them.  Provide a means of setting the backspace/delete
	bindings.  Add a poor xlfd_from_pango mapping function which would need
	serious work to be useful.  Get rid of warnings when we're transparent
	and the root window pixmap isn't as big as the root window because it's
	been tiled.  Setup bindings using the export functions.  Set the default
	terminal size to 80x24 instead of 60x18, which was originally chosen for
	debugging purposes.  Don't use $SHELL as the command to invoke when
	starting up a default command (as in the test app) -- libtool wrappers
	keep screwing this up.  Don't limit the number of characters we skip
	over in invalid multibyte sequences -- sometimes that's not enough.
	Hook up ts/te, ks/ke sequence handlers.
	* src/vteaccess.h: Fix a crashbug due to mismatch between parent field
	in the object's structure and its inherited object's type.  Fix more
	crash bugs due to initialization weirdness.  More to go.
2002-05-01 nalin
	* src/vte.c: Try @pkgdatadir@/termcap/$TERM when reading termcap files.
	This fixes the app on systems with no /etc/termcap, and also speeds up
	loads and reduces memory consumption for xterm-color at the expense of
	making on-the-fly emulation changes impossible.  Don't xor reverse with
	itself when drawing characters (this broke when snapshotting was added).
	* termcaps/Makefile.am, termcaps/xterm-color: include a default termcap
	for xterm-color.
	* src/termcap.c src/termcap.h: make _find_boolean return a gboolean
	instead of an int.

	finalize-time.

2002-04-30 18:06  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Track and free idle task tags properly.  Change F11 and
	F12 capabilities from 'k;' and 'F1' to 'F1' and 'F2'.  Send a NUL on
	control space. (#80350)  Allow setting and checking of word characters,
	and change select-by-word behavior to use the word character list.
	Emit "contents_changed" signals whenever the visible contents change,
	and "cursor_moved" when the cursor moves.  Add snapshotting method.
	Scroll when auto-margin handling moves the cursor to the next line.
	Assume that the locale charset is actually ISO-8859-1 when we're in
	a UTF-8 locale, so we don't toggle from UTF-8 to UTF-8.  Treat
	GDK_KP_Page_Up as a GDK_Page_Up, ditto for GDK_KP_Page_Down and
	GDK_KP_Tab and GDK_KP_Space.  Add vte_terminal_get_font().  Don't bother
	messing with ring buffers if we're resizing them to their current sizes.
	* src/pty.c, src/vte.c: Return a pid from vte_terminal_fork_command().
	* src/vteaccess.c, src/vteaccess.h: Add VteTerminalAccessible object
	type.  It might even work, mostly.

2002-04-29 14:25  nalin

	rendering the default.  Handle control-key sequences better, unless
	the input method is hiding the modifiers from us.  Set the default
	TERM variable to "xterm-color".
	* src/vte.c src/vte.h: Get rid of vte_terminal_set_core_font().

2002-04-26 19:14  nalin
	* src/vte.c: Punt all changes to background images and transparency

	rows.  Fix a bug in that.  Try to preserve what the user sees when the
	scrollback size changes.
	* src/vteapp.c: set a default scrollback buffer size of 100.
